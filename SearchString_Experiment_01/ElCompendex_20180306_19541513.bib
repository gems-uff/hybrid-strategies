abstract = {Companies increasingly recognize that IT plays a significant role in their current and future business strategies, and IT departments increasingly need to justify their role in terms of contributions to business goals. Currently, little experience exists on how to effectively create this missing business-IT link. In 2010, ECOPETROL, a global player in the oil and gas industry, launched an initiative to align their IT activities with their overall business goals. IT is becoming a key information provider for making business-oriented decisions and achieving business success. Consequently, the view of IT is from that of a support organization to that of a value-creating information provider. This article describes how ECOPETROL is utilizing IT services to improve their competitiveness in the marketplace. They are applying the GQM <sup>+</sup>Strategies&reg approach for measurement-based IT-business alignment. &copy; 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Software engineers are always aiming at improving software processes and products. However, the adoption of these improvements on software organizations must be aligned to their strategic goals. Otherwise, these improvements may not improve the organization. However, to guarantee this alignment can be complex, since improvement initiatives would have to be planned and monitored considering aspects starting from strategic level and going all the way to the organization daily operations. Thus, this work presents an approach to define and monitor software improvement goals, which are decompositions of strategic goals and are related to software products or processes. Our approach comprises strategic, tactical and operational planning activities, always aiming at strategic alignment. As important tools to monitor the goals defined, software measurement and statistical process control are also considered. An infrastructure to monitor the goals is described, and also an experience of use of the approach at a Brazilian software development organization. &copy; 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

Some of the top factors for process improvement and process deployment initiatives are: commitment, alignment with the business strategy and goals, training, communication, resources, skills, improvement management and staff involvement.

This paper explores the Service Oriented Architecture based IT reorganisation strategy within the information technology department of AirlineCo, a leading airline company, to handle the volatile business environment of the airline. Current challenges in the AirlineCo's IT information delivery life cycle are analysed in line with this new architectural strategy. An implementation approach is identified for this architecture examining other real world approaches and in line with the current investments. A combination of deductive and inductive approach is used to match theory to practice and arrive at a conclusion.},

Unfortunately, process descriptions generally do not correspond to the processes actually performed during software development projects.

It presents an unexpected benefit from this approach, which was the adoption of SPI processes by a non-software development area of the organisation. Current SPI models either fail to provide guidance on which processes to improve at first, in continuous models, or provide a set of processes that are not guaranteed to be the ones strategic to the organisation, in staged models. Thus, each particular organisation has to create a strategy to make such decision or venture into the risks of using a generic approach that may not be aligned with the organisation's needs.

Approaches like software product line engineering are considered promising to successfully tackle such challenges. However, to fully exploit its potential, any product- and reuse-focused development approach poses the need to closely link core software engineering activities with strategic and economic product aspects. Product management is generally expected to bridge this gap from business and product related goals to software life cycle activities, but often fails to deliver the promised outcomes. Moreover, software process improvement approaches generally lack the provision of explicit or detailed product management activities. - This paper presents the results of extracting key product management practices from selected software product line and product management frameworks.

abstract = {In order to manage the complexity of the alignment problem, we introduce the construct of workpractices as the main unit of analysis. A workpractice is a meaningful, goal oriented social entity where some actors produce a result that other actors need. The development of products or services provided by an organization is accomplished by coordinating the results of cooperating workpractices. Alignment is achieved by either adjusting the coordination between workpractices or adjusting internal workpractice elements such as processes and support systems. To make this approach operational, we suggest structuring a workpractice according to the Activity Domain Theory - a new theory for coordinating human activity. In this theory, particular emphasis is placed on the achievement of common understanding among the actors. Some results from applying this approach in the Ericsson telecommunication company are discussed. The findings indicate that the proposed approach is a promising way towards achieving and maintaining alignment. Copyright &copy; 2005 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.},
