abstract="Although assessment-based approaches and measurement-based approaches are often considered as competitors, they compliment each other very well. Assessments are strong in identifying improvement objectives within a relatively short time frame, but are weak in guiding the actual implementation of the proposed changes. Measurement, however, supports very well in supporting actual changes and providing feedback on the effects of these changes, but has a difficulty with selecting the right goals. In this paper, we suggest an approach in which focused assessments are used to identify improvement goals and to use goal-oriented measurement to guide the implementation of the actual changes.",

abstract="Process improvement studies have tended to focus on software process improvement (SPI) framework such as the generic ``best practices'' models (e.g., CMM and SPICE), SPI Models (e.g., PDCA and IDEAL), and Quality Improvement Paradigm (QIP). However, there are still difficulties due to the resistance within the organization and the tendency to return to the previous state. In this study, we point out it is the transition part that is overlooked in the SPI Model and explain how we apply transition management to software process improvement in the Software Center, Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. The study also shows that considering transition management during SPI planning leads to more accurate estimation for time and goal achievement of SPI work.",

abstract="In today's software development organizations, methods and tools are employed that frequently lack sufficient evidence regarding their suitability, limits, qualities, costs, and associated risks. The need to select the best-suited method, technique or tool in a given business context is becoming more and more important. From a business perspective the trade-off between time-to-market, quality, and cost is a crucial factor for the decision process. While new findings from research await their transfer into industrial practice, systematic assessment, selection and infusion of these findings with regard to business objectives and context is lacking. This paper presents ongoing research towards the development of a decision support system that aims at improving software engineering technology selection by software managers with regard to business goals. The focus of this paper is on presenting the problems at hand, the idea for a comprehensive decision support, and discussing the results of the requirements analysis process.",

abstract="The BOOTSTRAP methodology for software process assessment and improvement was initially developed by taking the original SEI model as a starting point and extending it with features based on the guidelines from ISO 9000 quality standards and ESA (European Space Agency) process model standards. The extensions were made in order to fit the methodology into the European context, and to attain more detailed capability profiles and maturity levels separately for organisations and their projects. The methodology was also provided with software tools and cumulative assessment data base support. Recently, the methodology has adopted also features of the becoming new ISO standard currently known as a SPICE Initiative. All this has made the BOOTSTRAP methodology particularly suitable for process improvement with different organisation types and sizes and with different kinds of software processes and products. The paper presents the BOOTSTRAP methodology and in conclusions brings forward especially the improvement related aspects that may set boundary conditions between different software process assessment and improvement approaches.",

Our approach moves away from the overall software development process and computation of maturity levels and focuses on a particular process area or task and its key practices. In determining process key practices our framework considers process dimension, and quality and usability/costumer satisfaction of the products produced or services provided by the process. The refined version of the model gives suggested types of key practices and useful questions and hints for constructing these key practices. We show the completeness, flexibility and ease of using this proposed meta-model by applying it to two particular process areas, generating a set of key practices we believe adequately cover the key issues to properly drive a process improvement effort.",

The model complements established improvement methods such as CMMI, GQM, and Experience Factory and links them to those project management activities that often are the starting point of improvement initiatives.",

In the past few years many factors have determined changes in the software process scenario that inevitably impact on software quality.

The method takes benefit of the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) paradigm and mixes business goals defined by the top level management with the results of the SEI assessment in order to define action lists and associated measurements to follow the progress of the actions.
